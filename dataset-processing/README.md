# Dataset Processing

The purpose of this tool is to generate the datasets from the features extracted in the [Feature Extraction Phase](../feature-extraction/README.md) that will be used to train the models.

This stage is divided in four parts. The *Dataset Generation*, the *Feature Scaling*, the *Dataset Divison* and the *Non-defective Instances Removal*. Therefore, the first tool can be found in [Dataset Generation](dataset-generation/README.md). And, the last three tools can be found in [Dataset Preparation](dataset-preparation/README.md).
